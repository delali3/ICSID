TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR THE AI

Generate semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard-navigable menus.

Use a restrained green + gold accent; never overpower text contrast.

Keep headings short; avoid boilerplate “AI” phrases.

Add JSON-LD for an “Event” (Conference) including name, startDate, endDate, location (UMaT-SRID), organizer, and url.

Create a Hotels list component that reads from the JSON schema above, with client-side filter/search.

Prepare placeholders for submission/registration links and the CFP PDF.

Optimize Lighthouse scores (performance, accessibility, SEO ≥ 90).

Do not use stocky, over-processed hero images; prefer subtle geometric textures or soft campus shots with green overlay.

Deliverables
A complete, production-ready, multi-page site with the sections above, styled with the given palette and tone, including the hotels directory and all conference data populated.
